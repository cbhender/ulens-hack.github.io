# Welcome

This hack session will focus on unsolved problems in modeling
microlensing events. It will be held jointly with the annual
microlensing workshop. The primary goal of the hack session is to
engage people outside the traditional microlensing community in open
problems in microlensing research.


Open problems include:
* How to efficiently search a complex (non-Gaussian) multi-variate parameter space.
* How to weight degenerate solutions?
* Efficient computational methods for solving the triple lens equation

See the [projects](/projects/) page for more detailed descriptions. 

The [resources](/resources/) page has a list of useful references
including links to public tools and datasets.

# Logistics

The Hack Session will be held at the Center for Computational
Astrophysics in New York City
(/https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/). The
first 3 days will be joint with the 23rd Microlensing Workshop and will
provide an introduction to outstanding problems and resources. The
last two days will be devoted to hacking. A preliminary schedule is
available [here](/schedule/).

To register for the Conference (including the Hack Session), please
visit the main conference website (TBD).
