# Welcome

This hack session will focus on unsolved problems in modeling
microlensing events. It will be held jointly with the annual
microlensing workshop.

Open problems include:
* How to efficiently search a complex (non-Gaussian) multi-variate parameter space.
* How to weight degenerate solutions?
* Efficient computational methods for solving the triple lens equation

See the [projects](/projects/) page for more detailed descriptions.

# Logistics

The Hack Session will be held at the Center for Computational
Astrophysics in New York City
(https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/). The
first 3 days will be joint with the 2X Microlensing Workshop and will
provide an introduction to outstanding problems and resources. The
last two days will be devoted to hacking. A preliminary schedule is
available [here](/schedule/).

To register for the Conference (including the Hack Session), please
visit the main conference website (TBD).
